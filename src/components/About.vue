          Our theory of change is building dense networks around people trying
          to tackle messy socialecological, economic and political challenges.
          Having a dense network around you is one of the hallmarks of social
          capital, and gives you access to expertise, resources, skill sharing
          and financing. In a dense network, there are many ways for you to get
          from one point to another. A key challenge here is for people with
          aligned interests to find each other, and as a community weâ€™re out to
          solve just that.
